1) Clarify where Driver initialization, page loading should be located -
   BeforeSuite, BeforeMethod, base or custom class, etc.!
2) Add Allure reporting with screenshots

*** Misc ***
1) Different browsers (Selenium grid?)
2) Clear processing of exceptional situations - NoElementFound, etc.
3) Run tests via proxy: geo location detection via IP
4) Run tests in different time, cause page content depends on local time
5) What about locale? Is this service only in Russian?
6) @CacheLookup - do not search elements several times
